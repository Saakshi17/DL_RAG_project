 DeepLearning_RAG_Project_COMP_646

 This project is about detecting and mitigating hallucinations in Large language Models. 

 The setup.py file has all the functions which initilize the setup of the frontend code in the app.py file.
 The project can be run using
 python setup.py
 python app.py 
 streamlit run app.py
 The streamlit app runs on the local device and we can prompt the LLMs and check the outputs in both the models.
